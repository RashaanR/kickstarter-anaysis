# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Using the Kickstarter dataset set we already combed through, we will visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch 
dates and their funding goals.
### Purpose
We want to know how different campaigns fare in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
After analyzing the data we can see that theater plays had an average of 70 sucessful launches per month compared to an
average of 41 failures per month. It seems like the peak months were during May and June where successful plays top out
at 111 while failure during that time were at an all time high with 52 during May. Canecellations were pretty conssitent
through out the year with a range from 2-7 per month, with the execption of October where there were none. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
After analyzing the data for outcomes based on goals we can see that the most succesful plays were those we had goal of 19999$
or less compared to those who had a higher goal. There were 673 succesfull plays with a goal of 19999$ or less compared to the
17 of plays that failed and had a goal of 20000$ or more.   
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
There werent too many difficulites that were encountered. I think a huge dilema would of been if we didn't have the data segmented into subcatagories. 
## Results
What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Based on the data provided for outcomes based on launch date, we can conclude that the best time to launch a play is during May and June. We can aslo conclude that the most "non-ideal" time is in December. Based on the data provided for outcomes based on goals we can conclude that plays should try to have funding goals of 19999$ or less to increase chance of being successfull. If a pie chart was created we could see that over 65% of the successfull plays had a funding goal of 19999$ or less.
